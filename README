This library is provided under the LGPL license. It is based mainly on the
documentation provided by VLC and ffmpeg ASF parsers but it is however
rewritten and doesn't share any code with them except the necessary identifiers
and variable names that are file format specific.

Right now the status of this library is almost unusable but working. It is
written in ANSI C, compiled with '-Wall -ansi -pedantic' flags, doesn't use any
libraries and only very few libc functions. Therefore it should be highly
portable. The goal is to make the library usable with all major open source
music and video players. Already now it handles many errors better than its
predecessors.



License issues related to possible VLC derived code
---------------------------------------------------

Since libasf has used VLC as documentation and therefore could under some
circumstances be considered as a derived product, both marked copyright holders
of VLC's ASF parser code (Gildas Bazin and Laurent Aimar) have been contacted
and they have given approval for this project. To quote from the email
conversation:

Personnaly I don't mind at all and I don't think it violates any copyright if
as you say you basically rewrote everything. However fenrir wrote most of this
code in VLC so his opinion has probably more weight than mine.

Your implementation is fine with me, and if there is any doubt I accept the
re-licensing of the code I wrote for the VLC asf demuxer under LGPL (as at the
first look, the code seems to have the same workflow and structure).

Therefore there should be no copyright problems with libasf and LGPL license.
