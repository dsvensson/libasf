This library is provided under the LGPL license. It is based mainly on the
documentation provided by VLC and ffmpeg ASF parsers but it is however
rewritten and doesn't share any code with them except the necessary identifiers
and variable names that are file format specific.

Right now the status of this library is almost unusable but working. It is
written in ANSI C, compiled with '-Wall -ansi -pedantic' flags, doesn't use any
libraries and only very few libc functions. Therefore it should be highly
portable. The goal is to make the library usable with all major open source
music and video players. Already now it handles many errors better than its
predecessors.
